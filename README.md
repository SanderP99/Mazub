# Mazub
This is a mario bros-like game created for the OOP course at KU Leuven. The code for the user interface was given to us as were the tests. All the other functionality was implemented by us and this code can be found in the src folder.

The assignment was given to us in three parts and is located in the assignment folder.

This project was created by Sander Prenen and Warre Dreesen.
